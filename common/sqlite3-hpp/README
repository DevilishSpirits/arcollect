This is a toy headers to C++-ify SQLite3.

It's a very thin 1-to-1 mapping to the C API, sometime take advantage of C++ features.

Objects are wrapped into dummy structs, you use pointers which you dereference.

Objects support the delete operator and the API also accept std::unique_ptr<> for better memory safety.
