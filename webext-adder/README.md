# arcollect-webext-adder input/output format

The  `arcollect-webext-adder` is the program that handle WebExtension native host messaging. It communicate using JSON strings and add new artworks into the database.

# I/O format
Here is an example showing all possible cases (unless I forgot something ü§îÔ∏è).

When adding artwork, send the plain artwork with this kind of JSON :
```json
{
	"platform": "example.net",
	"artwork": [{
		"title": "Sample art",
		"desc": "My sample warmup for the morning.",
		"source": "https://example.net/art/123456/",
		"data": "<... base64 data ...>"
	}],
	"account": [{
		"id": 4213,
		"name": "@drawauthor",
		"title": "DrawAuthor make drawings",
		"url": "https://example.net/user/4213/",
		"icon": "<... base64 data ...>"
	}],
	"art_acc_link": [{
		"artwork": "https://example.net/art/123456/",
		"account": 4213,
		"link": "account"
	}]
}
```
The `platform` is the platform identifier, the root URL of the platform like `twitter.com`. 

The `artwork` array contain objects you wants to add with some properties :
* `title` is the artwork title.
* `desc` is the artwork description.
* `source` is the artwork URL. Caution ! This is a key in the database, reformat `window.location` in a way that the same artwork always have the same URL.
* `data` is the artwork file itself in base64 encoding.

The `account` array contain users you might wants to add with some properties :
* `id` is the user internal id on the platform. It should be an immutable numeric id if available, or `name`. This is a key in the database. For example on Twitter `1294737021714550784`, you can use text.
* `name` is the username on the platform. Often something not very pretty with a limited charset. For example on Twitter `"@DevilishSpirits"`.
* `title` is the pretty username, if different from the `name` title. For example on Twitter `"D-Spirits"`.
* `url` is the account URL.
* `icon` is the account avatar in base64 encoding.

The `art_acc_link` array contain links with artworks and profiles :
* `artwork` is the artwork `"source"` to link.
* `account` is the account `"id"`.
* `link` describre the type of link. Here `"account"` mean that this is the account which posted the artwork. Valid values are listed in the explanation of `art_acc_links` table in file [init.sql](https://github.com/DevilishSpirits/arcollect/blob/master/db-schema/init.sql).

This JSON is fully parsed before performing a transaction on the database. Item order in the JSON is not important.

The program add artworks into the database and return an empty object on this is done :
```json
{}
```
