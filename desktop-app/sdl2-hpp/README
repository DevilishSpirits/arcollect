Ultra-thin C++ wrapper for the SDL2.

It's a very thin and bare 1-to-1 mapping to the C API. No error checking is implied, objects are wrapped into dummy structs that you dereference because `this` is the raw SDL pointer and you never instanciate structs directly, you should use smart pointers like `std::unique_ptr<SDL::Texture>`. This is not a full C++ experience but enhance things a little-bit at no hidden cost.
