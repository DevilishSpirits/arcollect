		<p>You may want to save some artworks you find on the net. Right-click and save picture works but is not very convenient, forget the artwork source and classification is complicated.</p>
		<p>Arcollect aim to fulfill my needs of artwork collection management and to ease it&apos;s creation, browsing and growth that I do in a one click thanks to the web-extension which put a Save in Arcollect button on artwork pages. Metadata like the source, account, tags and the rating are also saved.</p>
		<p>It&apos;s goal is limited to easily browse and save artworks, it won&apos;t help you to discover new artworks or make any recommendations. No one can judge what&apos;s good or not better than you.</p>
		<p>Arcollect respect your privacy and will never judge you.</p>
