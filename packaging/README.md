# Arcollect packaging files

This directory contain files used to generate packages. You probably won't need these unless you want to package a custom version.

**Important!** You must have a working internet connection to build packages from source tarballs. The configuration process download additionnal dependencies.

## How to generate a package for my system ?
Configure the project into the `build` directory but do not build it, package generation will do it's own configuration/build process anyway. Then `cd` into `build/packaging` that contain configured versions of files under `packaging` and follow system specific instructions :

```sh
	# cd to_source_root
	meson build        # Configure in 'build' directory
	cd build/packaging
```

You may want to take a look into the *release* GitHub Actions workflow at [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](https://github.com/DevilishSpirits/arcollect/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml) to see exactly how releases are generated.

### [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org/) and derived
Run [`makepkg`](https://man.archlinux.org/man/makepkg.8) **with the `PKGBUILD.local` file !** Else you will download a release from GitHub, it's either useless or unwanted if you want to build a version with local modifications. Note that the PKGBUILD force a release configuration with LTO and optimizations turned on.

```sh
	makepkg -p PKGBUILD.local
```

### [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and derived
*Well... the process to create a source package is heavy and I didn't understood all details.* The binary Debian package is manually generated by the build-system. *Yes, that's dirty üôàÔ∏è !*

**Warning!** Dependencies are not yet filled correctly.

First, checkout the [Installation section](https://github.com/DevilishSpirits/arcollect#installation) of main README.md and install development version of packages that aren't *Known buggy*. 

Unlike other systems, you will build the directory you configured. This mean that you must configure the project to generate a correct package. **You must change the installation prefix to `/usr`**, also turning on stripping is required to pass lintian checks and you probably want to turn optimizations on.

```sh
	meson configure build --prefix=/usr -Dbuildtype=release -Dstrip=true -Db_lto=true -Dunity=on
	# Search for the Debian package filename output
	DEBNAME="$(grep -oEm 1 "arcollect_[0-9\.]+-1_$(echo -n "$(dpkg-architecture -q DEB_HOST_ARCH)").deb" build/build.ninja)"
	ninja -C build packaging/$DEBNAME
	lintian packaging/$DEBNAME # Check for errors
	sudo dpkg -i packaging/$DEBNAME
```
