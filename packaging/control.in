Description: @ARCOLLECT_SUMMARY@
 If you like visual arts, you may want to save some artworks you find on the
 net. Right-click and save picture works but is not very convenient, forget the
 artwork source and classification is complicated.
 .
 This personal project aim to fulfill needs of artwork collection management and
 to ease it's creation, browsing and growth that you do in a few clicks thanks
 to the web-extension which put a save button on artwork pages. Metadata are
 also saved like the source, account, tags and the rating.
 .
 Note that it's goal is to provide an easy way to browse your saved artworks.
 It will not help you to discover new artworks or make any recommendations, it's
 outside his scope. In fact, there is no mention of any platforms excluding if
 you use it or checkout the list of supported platforms and (trust me) it's
 better this way.
 .
 Under the hood, the application is powered with C++17 by the SDL2 and SQLite3
 for metadata storage.
 .
 This application respect your privacy and will never judge you.
